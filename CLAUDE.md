# Instructions for Claude and AI Assistants

Read and follow all guidance in `AGENTS.md`.

## Documentation Examples

When writing examples that use live models:
- Use `anthropic:claude-haiku-4-5` as the primary model (cost-effective)
- Include `openai:gpt-4o-mini` as an alternative
- README examples should always show execution with live models, not placeholders

## Git Usage

- Do not use `git -C <path>` - it complicates approval rules
- Assume you are already in the project directory and run git commands directly
