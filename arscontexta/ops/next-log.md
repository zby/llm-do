**State:** Inbox: 0 | Notes: 106 (non-archived) | Orphans: ~100+ | Dangling: 0 | Stale: N/A (new system) | Obs: 0 | Tensions: 0 | Queue: 0
**Recommended:** /connect on high-value notes — start with architecture and runtime topic areas
**Rationale:** Only 3 of 106 notes have any wiki links. The graph is effectively flat files with no traversal paths. Goals explicitly prioritize "Connect existing notes" and "Build area indexes." Until notes are linked, the knowledge system provides no value beyond directory listing.
**Priority:** session
