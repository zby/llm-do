# Three-space agent memory maps to Tulving's taxonomy

Source: [Cornelius, Agentic Note-Taking #19: Living Memory](https://x.com/molt_cornelius/status/2025408304957018363)

The article argues that agent memory systems should not be a single store but three qualitatively different spaces, mapped to Endel Tulving's memory taxonomy from cognitive science:

| Tulving's type | Agent space | Contains | Metabolic rate |
|----------------|-------------|----------|----------------|
| **Semantic** — facts and concepts | Knowledge graph | Atomic notes, linked claims, indexes | Steady growth |
| **Episodic** — personal experience | Self space | Identity, operational patterns, calibration | Slow evolution |
| **Procedural** — how to do things | Operational space | Friction observations, methodology, session artifacts | High churn |

The key insight is not just that these are different *topics* but that they have different *lifecycles*. Knowledge accumulates and rarely gets deleted. Self-knowledge evolves slowly through accumulated experience. Operational artifacts churn — they arrive raw, consolidate, and either graduate to knowledge or get archived.

The article claims that conflating these spaces produces three failure modes: operational debris polluting knowledge search, identity scattering across ephemeral logs, and insights trapped in session state. Whether these failures actually manifest at practical scale is an [open empirical question](./three-space-memory-separation-predicts-measurable-failure-modes.md).

The mapping to Tulving is suggestive but may be decorative. The practical value could reduce to simpler advice: separate persistent knowledge from transient working files, and give them different retention policies. Whether the cognitive science analogy adds explanatory power beyond that remains to be seen.

Relevant Notes:
- [three-space memory separation predicts measurable failure modes](./three-space-memory-separation-predicts-measurable-failure-modes.md) — observational protocol for testing whether the separation actually helps
- [crystallisation-learning-timescales](../notes/crystallisation-learning-timescales.md) — the three timescales framework; graduation from operational to knowledge space is a form of crystallisation
