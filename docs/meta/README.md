Observations about what works (and what doesn't) in knowledge systems for AI-assisted development. Notes here start as plain markdown. We may adopt structure (frontmatter, indexes, etc.) progressively as observations justify it.

The goal is to decide what knowledge base machinery we actually want for this project. arscontexta is our first large experiment — these observations are how we evaluate it and inform what comes next.

We're early in collecting these observations. Record what you notice. Separate observations from prescriptions — note that something adds complexity before concluding what should replace it.
