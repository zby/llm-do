# Needs testing

Ideas that look promising but haven't been tested enough to confirm.

## Extract, connect, review cycle

A three-phase pipeline: extract pulls insights from source material, connect finds relationships to existing notes (the backward pass — updating older notes to reference newer ones), review checks quality. The connect phase seems to be where most value is created. Likely needs tweaking.

## Input classification before processing

External sources (papers, articles, blog posts) may need different treatment than domain research or design explorations. Classifying input type before processing could prevent applying the wrong extraction strategy.
