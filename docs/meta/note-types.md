# Note types

Types for notes in `docs/notes/`. Added as a `type` field in frontmatter.

- **analysis** — examining something external through the lens of our project (upstream PR, paper, framework)
- **design** — proposing how something should work in our codebase
- **review** — examining our own code (audit, simplification, module inspection)
- **comparison** — side-by-side evaluation of alternatives
- **insight** — a claim or argument worth preserving
- **spec** — detailed requirements or structure
- **research** — exploratory investigation of a topic
- **index** — navigation hub connecting related notes

ADRs (`docs/adr/`) are a separate document type with their own template and don't need this field.
