# Links are decision points

A link is a hint: "you can learn more about this here." When a reader (human or LLM) is working on a task, they read a relevant article and encounter a link. Depending on the task, the linked information might be relevant or not. The link is a point of decision for the reader.

This means the link and its surrounding context need to inform that decision. The reader should be able to judge whether to follow the link without opening the target. The surrounding text, the link text itself (which doesn't have to match the target's title), and any inline explanation all contribute to that judgment. Prose-as-title is one shortcut — when the title is a claim, the link text itself carries enough information. But in general the whole surrounding context does the work. Bare links without context force the reader to open every link to decide.

Some pages are primarily collections of links — tables of contents, indexes. These are navigation pages where the reader's task is specifically to find the right link to follow. The context phrases next to each link are what make an index useful versus just a list.
