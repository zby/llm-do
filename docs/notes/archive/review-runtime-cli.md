# Runtime and CLI Review

## Context
Review of runtime orchestration, agent execution, toolset loading, and async CLI behavior.

## Findings
- No current findings. Previously noted UX inconsistencies (`--tui` messaging, approval flag validation, `--model` help text) have been resolved in the CLI.

## Analysis
- The remaining risk is documentation drift; keep CLI docs in sync with flag behavior.

## Possible Fixes
- Continue to align docs with CLI behavior as flags evolve.

## Recommendations
1. Keep CLI docs aligned with flag behavior and output modes.

## Open Questions
- None.

## Conclusion
This review is now informational only; the previously noted CLI UX issues have been resolved.
