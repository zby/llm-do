This frames the sandbox not just as a security boundary, but as the agent's
"world" - a programmable environment that the agent interacts with through code.

The agent writes code → sandbox executes it → tools are driven by that execution.

This is a different mental model from "agent calls tools directly". Instead,
the agent is a meta-programmer whose output (code) is what actually operates
the tools.
