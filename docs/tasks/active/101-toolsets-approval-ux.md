# Toolsets and Approval UX Improvements

## Prerequisites
- [ ] None.

## Goal
Toolset approvals are consistent and tool execution stays isolated and well-specified.

## Tasks
- [ ] Move shell metacharacter blocking into `needs_approval` for consistent UX.
- [ ] Namespace custom tool modules using a stable path hash to avoid collisions.
- [ ] Improve JSON schema generation for `Optional`/`Union` type hints.
- [ ] Avoid full-file loads in `read_file` when `max_chars` is set.
