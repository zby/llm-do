# Textual UI Consistency Fixes

## Prerequisites
- [ ] None.

## Goal
Textual UI docs and event handling align with current backend behavior.

## Tasks
- [ ] Update `docs/ui.md` to reflect the Textual backend and approval events.
- [ ] Render `ToolReturnEvent.result` in tool result views (or support both paths).
- [ ] Implement or remove `_update_approval_bindings` to avoid dead UX code.
- [ ] Handle `approval_request` explicitly in display backends.

## Current State
Created from review notes; not started.

## Notes
