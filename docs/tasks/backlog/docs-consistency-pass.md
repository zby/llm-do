# Docs Consistency Pass

## Idea
Align documentation sources of truth, starting with test commands and UI backend descriptions.

## Why
Conflicting guidance increases onboarding friction and leads to running tests in the wrong environment.

## Rough Scope
- Align README and AGENTS test command guidance.
- Update `docs/ui.md` to match the Textual backend.
- Decide on a single source of truth for high-level usage docs.

## Why Not Now
Needs agreement on preferred workflow and doc ownership.

## Trigger to Activate
Planned documentation refresh or contributor confusion about setup/testing.
