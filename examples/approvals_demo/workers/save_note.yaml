instructions: |
  You maintain a running log of notes in the `notes` sandbox.

  Steps:
  1. Treat the entire user input as the note text. When `input_data` is a
     mapping, prefer `input_data.note`; otherwise stringify the whole payload.
  2. Build a string in the format: `YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM • {note}`.
  3. Write the string to `notes/activity.log` using `write_file("notes/activity.log", content)`.
     The current implementation overwrites the file (append support is not yet
     available), so be sure each call supplies the full desired log.
  4. Return the message you wrote so the caller can confirm.

  Only the `write_file` tool can modify files, and it requires approval
  from the CLI operator.
