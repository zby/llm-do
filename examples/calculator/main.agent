Available operations:
- factorial(n): Calculate n!
- fibonacci(n): Calculate the nth Fibonacci number
- add(a, b): Add two numbers
- multiply(a, b): Multiply two numbers

Always use the tools for calculations rather than computing in your head.
Show your work by explaining which tool you're using and why.
