## Actionable Recommendations

1. **Investigate May-June Decline**: Identify what changed between May and June. Review campaign performance, traffic sources, and user feedback to prevent further degradation.

2. **Capitalize on Momentum**: The Jan-May growth is strong. Scale successful channels and campaigns while bounce rate remains low.

3. **Monitor Bounce Rate**: While improving overall, the June uptick warrants attention. Conduct UX audits to maintain the downward trend.

4. **Conversion Optimization**: Focus on the 109+ monthly conversion baseline as a launching point for A/B testing and feature improvements to sustain growth.

5. **June Forecast**: If June decline continues into July, consider whether it's seasonal or operational, and plan interventions accordingly.
