# AI deployment in cars — Research Insights

## Key Findings
- AI enables real-time processing of sensor data (camera, radar, LiDAR) for autonomous driving functions (evidence: https://www.neuralconcept.com/post/artificial-intelligence-in-car-manufacturing, https://www.a3logics.com/blog/edge-ai-for-autonomous-vehicles/)
- Edge AI processes data locally in vehicles for real-time decision making, addressing 1+ GB/second data generation (evidence: https://www.a3logics.com/blog/edge-ai-for-autonomous-vehicles/)
- Manufacturers are progressing from Level 0 to Level 4 autonomous driving capabilities (evidence: https://www.jato.com/resources/news-and-insights/ai-impact-on-automotive-industry)
- AI optimizes vehicle design through simulation-driven approaches for aerodynamics and crash safety (evidence: https://www.neuralconcept.com/post/artificial-intelligence-in-car-manufacturing)

## Risks
- Continued uncertainty around autonomy and safety standards
- Risk of blaming human drivers for autonomy failures
- Industry fragmentation with multiple competing architectures
- Dependence on AI systems introduces new failure points and maintenance requirements

## Recommendations
- Adopt diverse sensor modalities beyond just vision and radar for robust autonomous systems
- Implement effective driver monitoring systems to address responsibility concerns
- Balance edge AI processing with cloud capabilities for optimal performance
- Standardize ADAS domain controller architectures to reduce industry fragmentation
