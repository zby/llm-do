# AI deployment in hospitals — Research Insights

## Key Findings
- 71% of hospitals used predictive AI integrated into EHRs in 2024, up from 66% in 2023 (evidence: https://www.aapc.com/blog/93386-2024-saw-71-of-hospitals-using-predictive-ai/?srsltid=AfmBOoqwWhiVDLL1XEidBO8iTGG1yhpRnpXa8-oLSJ6KqfRQdMQGq1Ap)
- Significant adoption disparities exist between system-affiliated (86%) and independent (37%) hospitals (evidence: https://www.aha.org/aha-center-health-innovation-market-scan/2025-11-04-4-actions-close-hospitals-predictive-ai-gap)
- Large hospitals reached 96% adoption while small hospitals lagged at 59% (evidence: https://www.aapc.com/blog/93386-2024-saw-71-of-hospitals-using-predictive-ai/?srsltid=AfmBOoqwWhiVDLL1XEidBO8iTGG1yhpRnpXa8-oLSJ6KqfRQdMQGq1Ap)
- Rural hospitals show 56% adoption vs 81% for urban hospitals (evidence: https://www.aha.org/aha-center-health-innovation-market-scan/2025-11-04-4-actions-close-hospitals-predictive-ai-gap)

## Risks
- Digital divide threatens care consistency for vulnerable populations
- Potential bias and accuracy concerns with AI implementation
- Regulatory and ethical considerations around patient safety and algorithmic fairness
- High implementation costs and infrastructure requirements

## Recommendations
- Address adoption disparities between system-affiliated and independent hospitals
- Increase focus on clinical applications beyond administrative uses
- Strengthen AI governance and evaluation practices across all hospital types
- Invest in infrastructure to support rural and critical access hospital adoption
