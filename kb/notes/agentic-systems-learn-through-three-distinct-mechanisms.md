# Agentic systems learn through three distinct mechanisms

Herbert Simon: learning is [any change that produces a more or less permanent change in a system's capacity](learning-is-capacity-change.md) for adapting to its environment. In deployed agentic systems — systems that combine LLMs with persistent artifacts — we've identified three distinct mechanisms by which this happens:

| Mechanism | Operation | What changes | Medium transition |
|-----------|-----------|-------------|-------------------|
| **Stabilisation** | wide distribution → narrow | Output predictability | No — same medium, tighter constraints |
| **Crystallisation** | prompt → code | Verification regime, consumer, executability | Yes — natural language → executable |
| **Distillation** | discursive → procedural | Rhetorical mode, information density | No — same medium, different organization |

All three are learning in Simon's sense — they produce permanent changes in the system's capacity. They differ in what changes and whether the medium transitions. Each trades [generality for compound gains in reliability, speed, and cost](learning-is-capacity-change.md), but through different operations.

## Stabilisation

Every act of stabilisation fits Simon's definition. When you reduce variance — store an LLM output, write a convention, extract a deterministic function — you increase the system's adaptive capacity for the specific case stabilised.

### The spectrum of stabilisation

Stabilisation isn't just crystallisation (prompt → schema → code). It starts earlier and includes smaller acts:

| Stabilisation | What changes | Capacity gain |
|--------------|-------------|---------------|
| [Store an LLM output](storing-llm-outputs-is-stabilization.md) | Collapse a distribution to a point | One decision becomes permanent |
| Write a description field | Enable search without reading | One note becomes findable |
| Create a convention | Make future operations predictable | All operations of that kind become faster |
| Add structured sections | Enable type-specific operations | The document affords new workflows |
| Extract a deterministic function | Move from LLM to code | One operation becomes reliable, fast, free |

Each step trades generality (the document/process could have been anything) for something more specific and reliable. The mechanism is the same across the whole spectrum — it's just that full crystallisation changes the substrate entirely, making the compound gain largest.

### Softening is also learning

The reverse — softening, replacing a stabilised component with a general-purpose one — is also learning. It increases generality at the cost of the compound. When scale makes a general approach good enough on reliability+speed+cost, the [bitter lesson boundary](bitter-lesson-boundary.md) tells you to soften. Both directions are capacity change; they just operate on different [dimensions of capacity](learning-is-capacity-change.md).

### The KB as evidence

The KB itself demonstrates this. Every session that improves notes, sharpens connections, or discovers principles is stabilisation — and therefore learning. From fixing a typo (narrow scope) to discovering design principles (wide scope), the mechanism is the same: reduce variance, increase capacity. This is why [the KB already has a learning loop](../claw-design/automating-kb-learning-is-an-open-problem.md) — the open problem is automating the judgment-heavy stabilisations.

## Crystallisation

[Crystallisation](deploy-time-learning-the-missing-middle.md) is the most dramatic form of stabilisation — it crosses a medium boundary. Natural language instructions become executable code. The consumer changes (LLM → interpreter/runtime). The verification regime changes (stochastic → deterministic). It's a phase transition: the nature of the artifact changes fundamentally.

The [verifiability gradient](deploy-time-learning-the-missing-middle.md) — from restructured prompts through schemas and evals to deterministic code — is a compound capacity gradient: reliability, speed, and cost all improve together as you move down it. At the top sit [dynamic agents](dynamic-agents-runtime-design.md) — maximum generality, minimum reliability. At the bottom sits deterministic code — minimum generality, maximum reliability. The system's learning trajectory is its movement along this gradient.

## Distillation

[Distillation](../claw-design/skills-derive-from-methodology-through-distillation.md) is the mechanism by which a body of discursive reasoning (methodology notes, design arguments, source reviews) becomes operational procedure (skills). Unlike crystallisation, there is no phase transition — both input and output are natural language consumed by an LLM. What changes is the rhetorical mode: exploratory, multi-perspective argument becomes step-sequenced instruction.

The separation is deliberate: reasoning is factored out of the operational path, not lost. The methodology KB remains accessible for edge cases the distilled skill doesn't cover. This makes distillation a context-budget operation — it exists because [agent statelessness](../claw-design/agent-statelessness-makes-skill-layers-architectural-not-pedagogical.md) makes it too expensive to load the full reasoning every session.

## Reasoning

### The three mechanisms are distinct, not synonyms

It matters to distinguish them because conflating them produces confused designs:

- If you think skills are **crystallised** methodology, you'll expect them to be more verifiable than they are (they're still stochastic LLM instructions).
- If you think skills are **stabilised** methodology, you'll focus on constraining agent behavior rather than on extracting the right procedures.
- If you recognise skills as **distilled** methodology, you'll focus on the right questions: what to extract, what to leave in the source, how to maintain the derivation relationship.

Similarly, treating crystallisation as "just more stabilisation" misses the phase transition — the qualitative change when an operation moves from stochastic to deterministic substrate.

### The stabilise/soften cycle is a learning cycle

The stabilise/soften cycle described in [agentic systems are probabilistic programs](./agentic-systems-are-probabilistic-programs.md) is, viewed through Simon's definition, a learning cycle. Each stabilisation step makes the system more capable for the specific case it handles. Each softening step makes it more capable for the general case. The cycle isn't maintenance — it's how the system learns.

### Continuous learning is stabilisation during deployment

AI labs frame "continuous learning" as adapting a deployed model to new data without retraining — the hot topic in production AI. The claim here is that stabilisation through versioned artifacts [achieves the same goals](./continuous-learning-is-stabilisation-during-deployment.md) — durable adaptation, task-specific knowledge accumulation, improved performance over time — and does it better on inspectability, rollback, verification, and composability. The continuous learning problem is a special case: stabilisation that happens during deployment, on the basis of deployment experience.

## Caveats

- **Not all learning is covered by these three.** Weight-based learning captures distributional knowledge (style, tone, world knowledge) that doesn't reduce to explicit artifacts. The claim is that these three mechanisms cover most of what *deployed* systems need for continuous improvement, not everything.
- **Stabilisation requires curation.** Artifacts go stale, schemas need updating, conventions drift. The process assumes an active curation loop, whether human-driven or automated.
- **The compound gain only fully applies to operations that completely crystallise.** Partially stabilised operations — where a script handles 80% of cases and an LLM handles the rest — get partial gains, and the boundary needs ongoing maintenance.
- **Distillation may be a special case of stabilisation viewed differently.** One could argue that extracting procedures from reasoning IS narrowing the distribution — the agent's behavior is more constrained with a skill than with fifteen methodology notes. The distinction is in intent: stabilisation constrains, distillation extracts. Whether this holds up as a true separate mechanism or resolves into a perspective on stabilisation remains to be seen.
