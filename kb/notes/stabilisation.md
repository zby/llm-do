# Stabilisation

The learning mechanism where output variance is reduced without changing the medium. Storing an LLM output, writing a convention, adding structured sections to a document type, sharpening a description — all are stabilisation. The artifact stays in the same medium (natural language, markdown) but becomes more constrained, more predictable.

Stabilisation is the broadest of the three mechanisms and includes the smallest acts of learning. It starts before crystallisation and covers acts that never need to crystallise — a well-written description field is stabilised (findable, predictable) but will never become code.

Softening — replacing a stabilised component with a general-purpose one — is the reverse. It increases generality at the cost of the compound. The stabilise/soften cycle is a learning cycle.

Examples: storing an LLM output as a permanent artifact; writing a description field that enables search; creating a naming convention; adding structured sections to a document type.

Not stabilisation: moving a validation check from LLM to Python script (crystallisation — the medium changes); extracting a skill from methodology notes (distillation — the operation is extraction, not narrowing).

See [agentic systems learn through three distinct mechanisms](./agentic-systems-learn-through-three-distinct-mechanisms.md) for the full vocabulary.
