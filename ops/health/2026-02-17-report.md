Recommended Actions (top 3, ranked by impact):
1. Create area indexes and run /connect on the 10 active root-level orphan notes — these are the live design notes most likely to benefit from graph connections
2. Decide on archive/ and reviews/ policy — these 114 legacy notes lack frontmatter and are all orphaned; consider whether they should be bulk-excluded from health checks or given minimal schema
3. Add `areas` field to the 23 root-level docs/notes/ files that have frontmatter but no area links — this enables index-based navigation
