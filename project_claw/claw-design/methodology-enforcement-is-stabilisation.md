# Methodology enforcement is stabilisation

The ways we enforce methodology in the KB — instructions, skills, hooks, scripts — map directly onto the [stabilisation spectrum](../../docs/theory.md). The enforcement layers parallel the [crystallisation verifiability gradient](../notes/crystallisation-learning-timescales.md) — where crystallisation moves code from prompt tweaks through schemas to deterministic modules, methodology enforcement moves practices from written guidance through structured skills to automated scripts. Each layer trades flexibility for reliability by moving the trigger, the response, or both from stochastic to deterministic.

| Layer | Trigger | Response | Reliability | Example |
|-------|---------|----------|-------------|---------|
| Instruction | stochastic (LLM remembers) | stochastic (LLM interprets) | lowest | "check descriptions" in CLAUDE.md |
| Skill | deterministic (user invokes) | stochastic (LLM executes) | medium | `/validate` checks note quality |
| Hook (warn) | deterministic (event fires) | stochastic (LLM acts on output) | medium-high | validate-note.sh outputs WARN on missing description |
| Hook (block) | deterministic (event fires) | deterministic (rejected) | high | exit 1 prevents the operation |
| Script | deterministic (user/hook runs) | deterministic (code runs) | highest | sync_topic_links.py rewrites Topics footer |

The key insight: hooks are not cleanly "deterministic." A hook that outputs a warning is a deterministic trigger with a stochastic response — the LLM decides what to do with the warning. Only blocking hooks (exit non-zero) are fully deterministic. This means the three-tier model (instruction → skill → hook) that arscontexta uses oversimplifies — the real picture is a gradient, which is just stabilisation.

## Maturation trajectory

This is [progressive compilation applied to methodology](../notes/programming-practices-apply-to-prompting.md) — new best practices should start stochastic and stabilise as they prove out:

1. **Instruction** — write it in CLAUDE.md or WRITING.md. Cheap to revise, tests whether the practice is worth encoding. If the LLM follows it inconsistently, that's signal.
2. **Skill** — encode it as a structured prompt. Reliable when invoked, but requires explicit invocation. Good for judgment-requiring operations that shouldn't be automated.
3. **Hook/script** — automate the deterministic parts. Only after the practice has stabilised enough that you know exactly what the check should do.

**When to move down.** The strongest signal for automation is when the agent consistently proposes the same correct next step — the stochastic layer has converged to a point. If the LLM's response is predictable and always right, the prompt-to-action path is just overhead; a hook or script would do the same thing without the latency or token cost. This is the crystallisation trigger: a pattern has emerged from repeated execution, and stabilising it removes the stochastic middleman.

Not everything should complete the trajectory. Operations requiring semantic judgment (like "is this connection genuine?") belong permanently at the skill level — their [oracle strength](../notes/oracle-strength-spectrum.md) is too low to support deterministic verification. Attempting to automate judgment produces confident systematic errors — the over-automation risk. The [topic-links-from-frontmatter case](./observations/topic-links-from-frontmatter-are-deterministic.md) is a clean example of the trajectory completing: an LLM-generated Topics footer was recognised as fully mechanical, and the operation moved to a deterministic script.

The maturation trajectory parallels [document type maturation](./document-types-should-be-verifiable.md) — just as documents start as untyped `note` and gain type information as they crystallise, practices start as written guidance and gain enforcement structure as they prove out. Both are gradual typing applied to different substrates: types accumulate verifiable structural properties; enforcement accumulates deterministic triggers and responses. The [context loading hierarchy](./context-loading-strategy.md) mirrors the same gradient from the information-delivery side — CLAUDE.md instructions, skill descriptions, skill bodies — but for loading specificity rather than enforcement reliability.

## Current state

We have hooks in `.claude/hooks/` but they aren't wired up (`"hooks": {}` in settings.json) and reference old paths. We have scripts that work (sync_topic_links.py, generate_notes_index.py). We have skills that work (validate, connect, ingest). We have instructions that work (CLAUDE.md, WRITING.md). The gradient exists — we just haven't needed to push anything further toward the deterministic end yet.

## Open questions

- When should a WRITING.md instruction become a validate check? [Oracle strength](../notes/oracle-strength-spectrum.md) may provide the answer: a practice is ready to move down the gradient when you can cheaply verify whether it was followed correctly. If verification requires semantic judgment, the practice stays at skill level; if it can be reduced to structural checks, it is a candidate for scripting.
- Should hook warnings be treated differently from skill output? The LLM sees both as text, but the trigger mechanism differs.
- Are there practices currently at skill level that should be scripts? (sync_topic_links.py was probably this — a skill-level operation that turned out to be fully deterministic.)

Relevant Notes:
- [crystallisation: the missing middle](../notes/crystallisation-learning-timescales.md) — grounds: the verifiability gradient for code (prompt tweaks -> schemas -> evals -> deterministic modules) is the general pattern this note instantiates for methodology
- [crystallisation is continuous learning](../notes/crystallisation-is-continuous-learning.md) — foundation: the stabilisation gradient for code; this note applies the same gradient to methodology
- [programming practices apply to prompting](../notes/programming-practices-apply-to-prompting.md) — synthesizes: the maturation trajectory is progressive compilation applied to methodology — flexible instructions frozen into rigid, efficient automation
- [topic links from frontmatter are deterministic](./observations/topic-links-from-frontmatter-are-deterministic.md) — exemplifies: a skill-level operation that completed the maturation trajectory into a deterministic script
- [what doesn't work](./what-doesnt-work.md) — examples: validation ceremony and session rhythm protocol as premature automation
- [document types should be verifiable](./document-types-should-be-verifiable.md) — parallels: document type maturation (note -> traits -> promoted base type) follows the same gradual-typing pattern as methodology maturation (instruction -> skill -> hook -> script); both trade flexibility for reliability as verifiability increases
- [oracle strength spectrum](../notes/oracle-strength-spectrum.md) — determines when a practice is ready to move down the enforcement gradient: cheap verification enables scripting; expensive verification keeps the practice at skill level
- [context loading strategy](./context-loading-strategy.md) — mirrors: the loading hierarchy (CLAUDE.md -> skill descriptions -> skill bodies) parallels the enforcement hierarchy, but for information specificity rather than practice reliability
