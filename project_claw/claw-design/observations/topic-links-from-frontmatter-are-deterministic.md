# Topic links from frontmatter are deterministic

**Implemented.** See [ADR-001: Generate Topic links from frontmatter](../adr/001-generate-topic-links-from-frontmatter.md).

The `areas:` frontmatter field lists which indexes a note belongs to. The Topics footer section contains markdown links to those same indexes. The mapping is mechanical: read `areas`, write links. This was a concrete stabilization candidate — now automated via `scripts/sync_topic_links.py`.

See [storing LLM outputs is stabilization](../../notes/storing-llm-outputs-is-stabilization.md) for the general pattern.

Topics:
- [claw-design](./../claw-design.md)
- [links](./../links.md)
