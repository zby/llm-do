# Instructions are typed callables with document type signatures

[Document types mark affordances](../claw-design/document-types-should-be-verifiable.md) — a `structured-claim` affords verification, a `spec` affords implementation, an `index` affords navigation. Each type step [trades generality for compound gains in reliability, speed, and cost](./learning-is-capacity-change.md): the structure guarantees the parts are there, making operations reliable without reading the whole document first.

But some documents aren't data — they're *procedures*. Skills, tasks, workflows: their primary affordance is *being followed*. A task has prerequisites, a goal, a checklist of steps, a verification plan. An agent picks it up and executes it. Skills are the same — `/ingest` is a procedure that transforms a source into a `source-review`. These are the document equivalent of callables: the content is a procedure, and the valid operation is execution.

## Skills have type signatures

If types mark valid operations on documents, then instructions that operate on documents should declare which types they accept — the same way functions declare parameter types.

Currently KB operations take a path and hope for the best. `/connect` implicitly expects a `note` or `index`. `/ingest` expects a source file. A verification workflow would expect a `structured-claim`. None of them check.

With type annotations on instructions, you get early validation: "this document is an `index`, but this workflow operates on `structured-claim` — wrong type." The instruction is a function, the document is an argument, and the document's type determines whether the operation is valid.

This gives skills type signatures:

| Skill | Signature |
|-------|-----------|
| `/ingest` | `source → source-review` |
| `/connect` | `note \| index → note \| index` (mutates links) |
| `/validate` | `note → validation-report` |
| `/convert` | `text → note` |

The operations afforded by a type can sit anywhere on the stochastic-deterministic spectrum — a deterministic check (does this `structured-claim` have an `## Evidence` section?) or a stochastic judgment (does the evidence actually support the claim?). The type is the interface; the implementation can [crystallise](./agentic-systems-learn-through-three-distinct-mechanisms.md) from LLM to code as patterns stabilise.

## Open questions

- Should skill signatures be declared in the skill file itself (machine-readable) or just documented?
- What happens when a skill accepts a union type — does it behave differently per type, or is the union the real input type?
- How do compound documents work — a note that contains both claims and questions?
