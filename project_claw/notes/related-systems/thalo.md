# Thalo

**Thought And Lore Language** — a structured plain-text format for personal knowledge management designed for AI collaboration. Inspired by plain-text accounting (Beancount, Ledger), it adapts that philosophy to knowledge bases.

**Repository:** https://github.com/rejot-dev/thalo
**Status:** Pre-1.0, actively maintained, well-engineered (monorepo, LSP, TypeScript)

## Core Ideas

**"Unit tests for knowledge."** The central claim is that knowledge bases and codebases are similar — both need good structure to compound, both decay without it. Thalo provides a validation feedback loop: AI generates entries, `thalo check` validates them against 27 rules, creating iterative refinement. This is strikingly close to our [oracle hardening](../oracle-strength-spectrum.md) — they're manufacturing hard oracles for knowledge quality.

**Grammar-based type system.** Entities define types of knowledge (e.g. `opinion`, `reference`, `lore`, `journal`) with typed metadata fields (`string`, `date`, `link`, literal unions like `"article" | "video"`) and required/optional content sections. Values are parsed into typed AST nodes by Tree-Sitter, not regex-validated. This is our [types mark affordances](../instructions-are-typed-callables.md) principle taken to its logical extreme — a full compiler rather than YAML frontmatter conventions.

**Plain text is paramount.** Pure text files in git, no database, no lock-in, works with any editor. Full scripting API. This aligns with our markdown-as-source-of-truth stance and the filesystem-over-databases pattern shared across all systems we track.

**Actualization abstraction.** Syntheses combine a query (what entries to pull) with a prompt (how to synthesize them). Running `thalo actualize` outputs sources + prompt as text — deliberately decoupled from any specific LLM. The knowledge specification is separate from the LLM invocation. This is a clean separation we don't currently have.

**Incremental everything.** Document edits apply incrementally (Tree-sitter edit API), semantic model updates incrementally, rules declare dependencies for targeted invalidation. The workspace is a live, incrementally-updated semantic model across files.

## The Shared Bet

Thalo is the system closest to our theoretical position. They explicitly argue that knowledge should be treated like code — with schemas, types, validation, version control. This is [programming practices applied to knowledge management](../programming-practices-apply-to-prompting.md) taken to its logical conclusion — where we apply typing, testing, and progressive compilation through conventions, they built an actual compiler. Their entity/entry system is our [document classification](../../claw-design/document-classification.md) with types and traits, but expressed as a formal grammar instead of YAML conventions.

The comparison illuminates a design spectrum:

| Dimension | Thalo | Claw |
|-----------|-------|------|
| Type system | Custom DSL, Tree-Sitter grammar | YAML frontmatter, convention-based |
| Validation | 27 compiler rules, deterministic | Skills + scripts, mix of deterministic and stochastic |
| Tooling | LSP, Prettier, VSCode extension | rg, skills, qmd |
| Format | Custom `.thalo` (embeddable in markdown) | Plain markdown |
| Schema evolution | `alter-entity` directive | Edit templates, update conventions |
| Link model | Typed links parsed by grammar | Markdown links with semantic context in prose |

## Key Divergences

**They built a language; we stayed in markdown.** The trade-off is clear: a custom grammar gives you compiler-grade validation, LSP, incremental parsing. But it also means a new syntax to learn, tooling to maintain, and knowledge locked into a format that only thalo tools can process. Our markdown approach is lower-ceremony, works with every tool that reads text, but validation is softer.

**Same destination, different trajectory.** Our type systems aim at the same thing — types with defined sections, checkable structure. The difference is timing: they committed to their types upfront via a formal grammar; we're [discovering ours through practice](../../claw-design/document-types-should-be-verifiable.md), waiting for enough examples before formalising. We don't yet know what types we want — structured sections for related-system notes emerged organically, arguments (assumptions → observations → derivation → claim) are another candidate, but we need more recurring shapes before the right type definitions become obvious rather than speculative. Their grammar gives them deterministic validation now; our approach avoids premature commitment but validation is softer until types crystallise.

**They don't have a learning theory.** Thalo has validation (is this entry well-formed?) but no framework for deciding *when* to formalise something vs. leave it stochastic. No [crystallisation gradient](../crystallisation-learning-timescales.md), no stabilise/soften boundary. Their 27 rules are all fixed at design time — equivalent to jumping straight to the "script" level of the [methodology enforcement gradient](../../claw-design/methodology-enforcement-is-stabilisation.md), skipping the instruction and skill phases where practices prove out before hardening.

**No link semantics.** Their links are typed (the grammar knows `link` vs `link[]`) but don't carry relationship semantics. Our [link contracts](../../claw-design/link-contracts-framework.md) — extends, foundation, contradicts, enables — have no counterpart.

## What We Could Borrow

- **The "unit tests for knowledge" framing.** Resonates with oracle hardening but is more accessible language. Could be useful when explaining our approach.
- **Synthesis as map-reduce over knowledge.** Their `define-synthesis` is a saved query + prompt pair — a repeatable synthesis specification. The general mechanism is map-reduce: query selects entries, prompt maps over them, LLM reduces to output. Powerful pattern but needs a use case where you repeatedly ask the same shaped question over changing inputs. We don't have that pattern yet.
- **Incremental workspace model.** If we ever build tooling beyond rg + skills, their architecture (workspace → documents → incremental semantic analysis) is a good reference.

## What to Watch

- Do they develop schema evolution patterns (how types change over time) that inform our document classification evolution?
- Does the custom-language approach prove durable, or does maintenance burden push them toward simpler formats?
- How do they handle the boundary between what's formalised in the grammar and what stays free-form? This is their version of the crystallisation question.
- Does the validation feedback loop (AI generates → thalo checks → AI fixes) actually produce better knowledge over time? This would validate the shared programming-theory bet.

Relevant Notes:
- [oracle-strength-spectrum](../oracle-strength-spectrum.md) — foundation: Thalo's 27 rules are hard oracles manufactured for knowledge quality; the comparison illuminates what "oracle hardening" looks like when pursued to full formalization
- [instructions-are-typed-callables](../instructions-are-typed-callables.md) — foundation: Thalo's entity system is this principle taken to a full compiler; our YAML conventions occupy a different point on the same spectrum
- [programming-practices-apply-to-prompting](../programming-practices-apply-to-prompting.md) — synthesizes: Thalo is the most extreme example of programming practices (typing, testing, compilation) applied to knowledge management — they built an actual compiler where we use conventions
- [crystallisation-learning-timescales](../crystallisation-learning-timescales.md) — contrasts: Thalo has no crystallisation gradient; their rules are fixed at design time, while the verifiability gradient explains why progressive formalization (prompt -> schema -> code) beats upfront commitment
- [document-types-should-be-verifiable](../../claw-design/document-types-should-be-verifiable.md) — converges: same goal (types with defined sections, checkable structure), different trajectory — they committed upfront via grammar, we discover through practice
- [document-classification](../../claw-design/document-classification.md) — converges: our base types + traits model and Thalo's entity definitions aim at the same thing — structural contracts on knowledge — at different maturity stages
- [methodology-enforcement-is-stabilisation](../../claw-design/methodology-enforcement-is-stabilisation.md) — contrasts: Thalo jumped straight to deterministic scripts; we maintain a gradient (instruction -> skill -> hook -> script) because not all methodology should complete the trajectory
- [link-contracts-framework](../../claw-design/link-contracts-framework.md) — gap: Thalo's typed links have no relationship semantics; our link contracts provide the semantic layer their grammar omits
- [Ars Contexta](./arscontexta.md) — sibling: both are compared against our theoretical position; arscontexta grounds in cognitive psychology where Thalo grounds in programming language theory, making them complementary reference points
- [files-not-database](../../claw-design/files-not-database.md) — convergence: Thalo's "plain text is paramount" independently validates the filesystem-over-databases pattern
